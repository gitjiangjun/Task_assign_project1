CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:13 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcpp_parameter_event_handler.cmake" in
  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package
  configuration file provided by "cpp_parameter_event_handler", but CMake did
  not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "cpp_parameter_event_handler" with any of the following names:

    cpp_parameter_event_handlerConfig.cmake
    cpp_parameter_event_handler-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "cpp_parameter_event_handler" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "cpp_parameter_event_handler_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "cpp_parameter_event_handler"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
