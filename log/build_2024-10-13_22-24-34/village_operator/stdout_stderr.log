CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:13 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcpp_parameters.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "cpp_parameters", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "cpp_parameters"
  with any of the following names:

    cpp_parametersConfig.cmake
    cpp_parameters-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "cpp_parameters" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "cpp_parameters_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "cpp_parameters" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
